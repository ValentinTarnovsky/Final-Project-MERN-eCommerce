# Trend Store - Final eCommerce Project

Welcome to Valentin Tarnovsky's final eCommerce project at EducationIT! This eCommerce platform was developed as part of the bootcamp using modern technologies to create a platform for buying and selling Apple products.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- React
- Sass (for styling)
- Material-UI (for UI components)
- Axios (for making HTTP requests)
- Formik and Yup (for handling forms and validation)

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (with Mongoose as ODM)
- Cors (for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

## Application Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture, where the frontend developed in React communicates with the backend implemented in Node.js and Express. MongoDB database is used to store product and user information.

## Challenges Overcome

During the development of this project, I faced challenges such as handling HTTP requests between the frontend and backend, implementing business logic for product buying and selling, and integrating user authentication. These challenges were overcome through careful planning and problem-solving.

## Error Handling and Data Validation

Proper error handling was implemented both in the frontend and backend, using libraries like Axios to capture HTTP request errors and Joi for validating data in the backend. In the frontend, controlled forms were used along with Yup for user input validation.

## Key Features

- Navigation between different sections of the store
- Product viewing with full details
- Shopping cart for adding and removing products
- Eeasy checkout process
- Product management for sellers
